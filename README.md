This GitHub project is dedicated to HR Insights Dashboard built with Power BI. The dashboard offers valuable insights into HR metrics by combining the steps of data cleaning and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries. Here's what you can expect:

1. **Data Cleaning:** We start by cleaning HR data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This is a crucial step in ensuring the reliability of our insights.

2. **DAX Queries:** We leverage Data Analysis Expressions to create complex calculations and transformations, allowing us to extract meaningful insights from the data.

**Key Insights:**

- **Presence % by Date:** Track employee presence over time to identify trends and patterns.
- **WFH % by Date:** Analyze the percentage of employees working from home on different dates.
- **SL % by Date:** Monitor the percentage of employee sick leave on specific dates.
